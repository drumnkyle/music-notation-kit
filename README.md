This library will have a rendering engine for music notation as well as the ability to export and import different file formats, such as [MusicXML](http://www.musicxml.com) and a binary format. Also, it will most likely help with some form of MIDI playback.

There is a separate repo that this project depends on that is completely cross-platform called [MusicNotationCore](https://github.com/drumnkyle/music-notation-core). It has the data layer and most of the main functionality.

Please consult this [Swift style guide](https://github.com/drumnkyle/swift-style-guide) for coding style guidelines used in this repo and be sure to adhere to them.

There is a Slack channel you can join if you want to see more into the development process at [Music Notation Swift Slack](https://musicnotationswift.slack.com).
